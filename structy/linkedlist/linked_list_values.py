  Description:
    Write a function, linked_list_values, that takes in the head of a linked list as an argument. The function should return a list containing all values of the nodes in the linked list.

  Thoughts:
    we have to iterate through the linked list and store each value in a new list.
    the way we can do this is to store head in a variable and we can loop while that variable is not None
    then we can move to the next node by setting the variable to head.next
