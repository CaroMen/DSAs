# Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

# Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].

# INPUTS/OUTPUTS
#   nums = [2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 7], n = 3 => [2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 7]
#   x = [2, 5, 1], y = [3, 4, 7]
#   we want to place each of the y elements right after each of the x elements
#   somewhat like a zip problem

def shuffle(nums, n):
    pass
